# otpy v0.0.3

otpy is a python rewrite of the popular 1974 game "The Oregon Trail",
developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger and
published by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC).

otpy was made simply to improve my python skills, I'm not trying to
make exactly the next big thing here. otpy runs best on Windows systems, however,
it is still possible to run it cross-platform as well (see below).
