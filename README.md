# otpy v0.0.5_b4 (TESTING REPO)

otpy is a python rewrite of the popular 1974 game "The Oregon Trail",
developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger and
published by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC).

otpy was made simply to improve my python skills, I'm not trying to
make exactly the next big thing here. otpy currently only runs on Windows due to batch file usage, cross-platform support (with bash) coming in near future.
