# otpy v0.0.2

otpy is a simulator of the popular 1974 game "The Oregon Trail",
developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger and
published by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC).

otpy was made simply to improve my python skills, I'm not trying to
make exactly the next big thing here. Also, as of right now, otpy
only runs on Windows systems (or through wineconsole on Linux/macOS) due to it's use of
batch files. I will probably set up bash file alts in the future, but while the
game is still in such early development, I'll just hold off on that for
the time being.

Linux/macOS using wineconsole:

- if you have wine, you should already know how to run batch files
  and python through a wineconsole.
